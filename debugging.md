# Debugging Checklist (Git)

Run these in order when something is wrong:

git status     # current state
git branch     # current branch
git log        # commits exist?
git remote -v  # remote configured?
git config -l  # user name/email

## Questions to ask
- Am I in the right folder?
- Do I have a commit?
- Does the branch exist?
- Am I pushing to the right remote?
