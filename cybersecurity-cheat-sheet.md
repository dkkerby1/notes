# Cybersecurity Cheat Sheet

## Core Security Principles (CIA Triad)
Confidentiality – prevent unauthorized access
Integrity – prevent unauthorized modification
Availability – ensure systems/data are accessible

## Authentication vs Authorization
Authentication – who you are
Authorization – what you can do

## Common Threats
Phishing – trick users into revealing info
Malware – malicious software
Ransomware – encrypts data for payment
Man-in-the-Middle – intercepts communication
DoS / DDoS – overwhelm systems to cause downtime

## Basic Security Controls
Firewalls – filter network traffic
Antivirus – detect and remove malware
Encryption – protect data at rest and in transit
Backups – protect availability
Logging/Monitoring – detect incidents

## Password Best Practices
Use long passphrases
Unique passwords per service
Password managers
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## Encryption Basics
At rest – data stored on disk
In transit – data moving over network (HTTPS, TLS)

## Least Privilege
Users should have only the access they need
Reduce damage from compromise

## Incident Response (High Level)
Identify
Contain
Eradicate
